# BrewGrade: AI-Powered Tea Leaf Grade Prediction

**Last Updated: July 31, 2025, 11:03 PM IST (+0530)**

Welcome to BrewGrade, an innovative AI-powered application designed to predict tea leaf grades using computer vision. This project empowers tea farmers and producers by classifying tea leaves into four pekoe grades: FTGFOP (Finest Tippy Golden Flowery Orange Pekoe), GFOP (Golden Flowery Orange Pekoe), OP (Orange Pekoe), and Reject. Built with MobileNetV2 for feature extraction and a Random Forest Classifier for classification, BrewGrade offers a fast, reliable, and user-friendly solution for tea quality assessment.

## Project Overview

BrewGrade leverages advanced computer vision techniques to analyze tea leaf images and determine their quality grade. The application is ideal for:
- **Tea Farmers**: For quality control and grading at the source.
- **Tea Producers**: To streamline production and ensure consistency.
- **Enthusiasts**: To explore tea grading with cutting-edge technology.

The project uses MobileNetV2, a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) pre-trained on ImageNet, to extract features, followed by a Random Forest Classifier for grade prediction, achieving an accuracy of approximately 84% on the test set. The Streamlit-based web app provides an intuitive interface for uploading images and receiving instant predictions.

## Dataset

The BrewGrade model was trained on a dataset downloaded from Roboflow, consisting of tea leaf images categorized into four initial labels (T1, T2, T3, T4), which were mapped to FTGFOP, GFOP, OP, and Reject respectively.

### Dataset Details
- **Source**: Obtained via Roboflow from the "tea-dataset-w9n3c" workspace, project "tea-leaves-dataset", version 1, in COCO format.
- **Size**: 
  - Total images: Approximately 1,766 (based on the train set annotation file).
  - Split into train, validation, and test sets (exact split sizes depend on Roboflow's default distribution).
- **Preprocessing**: Images are resized to 224x224 pixels and preprocessed using MobileNetV2's `preprocess_input` function. The dataset includes augmentation techniques like rotations, flips, and brightness adjustments (implicit in the notebook's intent).
- **Annotations**: Initially labeled as T1, T2, T3, T4, and remapped to FTGFOP, GFOP, OP, and Reject using a custom label mapping.

The dataset is stored locally (e.g., `e:\Tea Project\Tea-Leaves-Dataset-1`) after download. This grading system can be widened by incorporating a custom dataset with additional grades or regional variations, enhancing its adaptability.

## Model Training

### Architecture
TeaVision employs a hybrid approach:
- **Feature Extractor**: MobileNetV2, a pre-trained CNN on ImageNet, extracts features from tea leaf images using average pooling (via `GlobalAveragePooling2D`) to generate a fixed-size feature vector.
- **Classifier**: A Random Forest Classifier with 100 estimators classifies the extracted features into the four pekoe grades.

### Training Process
- **Framework**: TensorFlow for CNN feature extraction and scikit-learn for Random Forest training.
- **Data Preparation**: 
  - Images are loaded from `train` and `valid` directories, features extracted using MobileNetV2, and labels encoded using `LabelEncoder`.
  - Data split: 80% training, 20% testing (via `train_test_split` with `test_size=0.2`).
- **Hyperparameters**:
  - Random Forest: `n_estimators=100`, `random_state=42`.
  - MobileNetV2: Frozen layers, input shape `(224, 224, 3)`.
- **Hardware**: Training can be performed on a CPU or GPU (e.g., NVIDIA GTX 1080), with feature extraction accelerated by GPU if available.

### Model Saving
The trained Random Forest model can be saved using joblib (e.g., as `tea_model.pkl`), though the notebook does not explicitly save it. The label encoder can be saved as `label_encoder.pkl`.

## Accuracy Scores

The BrewGrade model achieved the following performance metrics on the final test set:
- **Accuracy**: ~84%
- **Precision**:
  - FTGFOP: 0.91
  - GFOP: 0.72
  - OP: 0.85
  - Reject: 0.92
- **Recall**:
  - FTGFOP: 0.89
  - GFOP: 0.82
  - OP: 0.76
  - Reject: 0.89
- **F1-Score**:
  - FTGFOP: 0.90
  - GFOP: 0.77
  - OP: 0.80
  - Reject: 0.90
- **Macro Avg**: 0.85 (precision), 0.84 (recall), 0.84 (f1-score)
- **Weighted Avg**: 0.85 (precision), 0.84 (recall), 0.84 (f1-score)

These scores indicate a robust model, with strong performance across all classes. The accuracy could potentially be improved further with a larger dataset or hyperparameter tuning.
