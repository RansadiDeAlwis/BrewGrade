# BrewGrade: AI-Powered Tea Leaf Grade Prediction

Welcome to BrewGrade, an innovative AI-powered application designed to predict tea leaf grades using computer vision. This project empowers tea farmers and producers by classifying tea leaves into four pekoe grades: FTGFOP (Finest Tippy Golden Flowery Orange Pekoe), GFOP (Golden Flowery Orange Pekoe), OP (Orange Pekoe), and Reject. Built with MobileNetV2 for feature extraction and a Support Vector Machine for classification, BrewGrade offers a fast, reliable, and user-friendly solution for tea quality assessment.

## Project Overview

BrewGrade leverages advanced computer vision techniques to analyze tea leaf images and determine their quality grade. The application is ideal for:
- **Tea Farmers**: For quality control and grading at the source.
- **Tea Producers**: To streamline production and ensure consistency.
- **Enthusiasts**: To explore tea grading with cutting-edge technology.

The project uses MobileNetV2, a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) pre-trained on ImageNet, to extract features, followed by a Support Vector Machine(SVM) for grade prediction, achieving an accuracy of approximately 84% on the test set. The Streamlit-based web app provides an intuitive interface for uploading images and receiving instant predictions.

## Dataset

The BrewGrade model was trained on a dataset downloaded from Roboflow, consisting of tea leaf images categorized into four initial labels (T1, T2, T3, T4), which were mapped to FTGFOP, GFOP, OP, and Reject respectively.

### Dataset Details
- **Source**: Obtained via Roboflow from the ["tea-dataset-w9n3c"](https://universe.roboflow.com/tea-dataset-w9n3c/tea-leaves-dataset) workspace, project "tea-leaves-dataset", version 1, in COCO format.
- **Size**: 
  - Total images: Approximately 1,766 (based on the train set annotation file).
  - Split into train, validation, and test sets (exact split sizes depend on Roboflow's default distribution).
- **Preprocessing**: Images are resized to 224x224 pixels and preprocessed using MobileNetV2's `preprocess_input` function. The dataset includes augmentation techniques like rotations, flips, and brightness adjustments (implicit in the notebook's intent).
- **Annotations**: Initially labeled as T1, T2, T3, T4, and remapped to FTGFOP, GFOP, OP, and Reject using a custom label mapping.

The dataset is stored locally after download. This grading system can be widened by incorporating a custom dataset with additional grades or regional variations, enhancing its adaptability.

## Model Training

### Architecture  
BrewGrade employs a hybrid approach:

- **Feature Extractor**: `MobileNetV2`, a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on ImageNet, extracts features from tea leaf images using average pooling (`GlobalAveragePooling2D`) to generate fixed-size feature vectors.  
- **Classifier**: A **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** with an RBF kernel classifies the extracted features into four Pekoe grades.

---

### Training Process

- **Frameworks Used**:  
  - **TensorFlow** ‚Äì For CNN-based feature extraction using MobileNetV2.  
  - **scikit-learn** ‚Äì For SVM classification and hyperparameter tuning.

- **Data Preparation**:  
  - Tea leaf images are resized to `224x224` pixels and preprocessed using MobileNetV2‚Äôs `preprocess_input()` function.  
  - Features are extracted from both training and validation sets.  
  - Labels are encoded using `LabelEncoder` from scikit-learn.  
  - Dataset is split into 80% training and 20% testing using `train_test_split` with `test_size=0.2`.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**:  
  - SVM parameters `C` and `gamma` were tuned on the validation set using a grid search strategy.  
  - Grid Search Space:
    - `C`: `[0.1, 1, 10, 100]`  
    - `gamma`: `['scale', 0.01, 0.001]`  
  - Models were evaluated using **macro-averaged F1-score** to ensure balanced performance across all classes.  
  - The best parameters found were:  
    ```python
    {'C': 10, 'gamma': 'scale'}  
    ```

- **Hardware Requirements**:  
  - The model can be trained and run on both **CPU and GPU**.  
  - Feature extraction using MobileNetV2 benefits from GPU acceleration (e.g., NVIDIA GTX 1080 or higher).



### Model Saving
The trained Random Forest model can be saved using joblib (e.g., as `tea_model.pkl`), though the notebook does not explicitly save it. The label encoder can be saved as `label_encoder.pkl`.

## Accuracy Scores

The BrewGrade model achieved the following performance metrics on the final test set:
- **Accuracy**: ~84%
- **Precision**:
  - FTGFOP: 0.91
  - GFOP: 0.72
  - OP: 0.85
  - Reject: 0.92
- **Recall**:
  - FTGFOP: 0.89
  - GFOP: 0.82
  - OP: 0.76
  - Reject: 0.89
- **F1-Score**:
  - FTGFOP: 0.90
  - GFOP: 0.77
  - OP: 0.80
  - Reject: 0.90
- **Macro Avg**: 0.85 (precision), 0.84 (recall), 0.84 (f1-score)
- **Weighted Avg**: 0.85 (precision), 0.84 (recall), 0.84 (f1-score)

These scores indicate a robust model, with strong performance across all classes. The accuracy could potentially be improved further with a larger dataset or hyperparameter tuning.
